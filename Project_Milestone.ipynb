    "# Introduction \n",
    "As humans we continually apply our knowledge in one area to learn things faster in another area. For example,  it is reasonably easier for a soccer player to learn how to play basketball compared to someone who has not played any sport. Can we apply this knowledge transferrability to machine learning? In machine learning, a good model is one that generalizes well to unseen data based on what it learns from the training data. Creating labelled data is expensive and is not always possible.  So effective utilization of existing labeled datasets can have many practical applications. In situations where there is a dearth of training data, transfer learning augments this generalization step by starting from models that have been trained on different data with similar or different tasks.    \n",
    "\n",
    "We will examine the application of transfer learning to the field  of sentiment analysis specifically in the task of predicting ratings from reviews. In addition, we are picking concepts from the area of active learning to make transfer learning more effective.\n"

    "# Background \n",
    "As a primary source of inspiration, we have used the PhD Thesis by Robert Remus titled Genre and Domain dependencies in Sentiment Analysis. Remus in the thesis examines the effect of genre and domain in various tasks related to sentiment analysis, one of which is sentiment polarity detection. He uses the concept of domain similarity. While various metrics for similarity are mentioned, the one we have used is JS Divergence to determine the similarity / divergence of word distributions of two domains. He also leverages JS Divergence to select a subset of instances from the source domain for creating a model for domain adaptation to the target domain. In his thesis, he uses instance selection(IS) to pick a subset from the source domain that is similar to the target domain. He shows that IS from source, and from source + target (9:1 ratio) is more effective than source only.\n",
    "\n",
    "A paper by Hal from 2007 looks at domain adaptation in the realm of supervised learning. It proposes a simple idea of augmenting the feature space of both the source as well as the target domain and use it as the input to a classifier which aims at learning a function to minimize the loss in the target domain.The idea was to take each feature in the source domain and make two version of it namely source-specific and generic.The same is done to the target domain with target-specific and generic.By augmenting the feature space, the algorithm learns to adapt on its own.This approach has been used well for tasks like parts of speech tagging, parsing in the paper but not sentiment analysis. We found this approach very intriguing and would like to apply this to sentiment analysis task as a backup if there are issues with our primary approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also looked at the transferrability of neural networks in a paper by Mou et al from 2016 titled: How Transferable are Neural Networks in NLP Applications? This paper looks at tranferrability in different tasks like sentence classification and also sentiment analysis. For sentiment analysis they looked at LSTM-RNN while CNNs were used for sentence classification. The paper also looks at how transferable  different layers of NLP neural models are. The paper finds that transferrability between tasks is dependent on how semantically equivalent the two tasks are. With specific relevance to our project, the paper reports  that for sentiment analysis, tranferring and finetuning the embedding layer as well as the hidden layer helps in improving performance. The output layer is more specific to the dataset and performs best when left initialized randomly. An interesting aspect of this paper is the question about when the parameters are ready to transfer. The paper reported a sharp increase in accuracy from epochs 1-5 which plateaus later. We intend to leverage this in our work.\n",
    "\n",
    "A more recent paper that looks at the problem of domain adaptation for sentiment learning is Domain Adaptation for Large Scale Sentiment Classification : A Deep Learning Approach, by Glorot, Bordes, Bengio. The paper uses an unsupervised deep learning approach (specifically de-ionized auto-encoders) to extract a meaningful feature representation of each review in an unsupervised fashion. They then train a sentiment classifier (SVM) on the features extracted with this auto-encoder. They find that sentiment classifiers trained with this approach outperform state-of-the-art methods in domain adaptation for sentiment classification on a benchmark of Amazon reviews composed of 4 types of Amazon products (the benchmark was created by Blitzer in 2007). While their work shows a substantial reduction in loss in transfer from source to target domain, there is still a loss. \n",
    "\n",
    "Yet another interesting work which may lend itself to transfer learning in sentiment analysis has been that of deep contextualized word representation in a paper published this year by Clark el al. This paper explores word vectors each token is assigned a representation that is a function of the entire input sentence. The vectors are derived from a bidirectional LSTM that is trained with a coupled language model(LM) on a large text corpus. The word vectors are learned functions of the internal states of a deep bidirectional language model (biLM). These representations are called ELMo(Embeddings from a language model). This paper investigates the performance of ELMo on several tasks including sentiment analysis where it reports an improvement of 1% in accuracy over state of the art. Adding ELMo to a model increases the sample efficiency considerably, both in terms of number of parameter updates to reach state-of-the-art performance and the overall training set size. Although, this paper does not allude to transfer learning, the efficiency gained here can be helpful when we want to minimize training time on source domain in order to be able to transfer sooner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our work in also about leveraging active learning to make transfer learning more effective. Active Learning Literature Survey by Burr Settles (Ref 15) is an interesting summary of many possible approaches to picking the instances we label in the target domain using active learning. There's a few that seemed particularly interesting. a) Labeling instances with maximum uncertainty in labeling using classification b) Using instances that are most likely to change the model. c) Using instances that have some combination of uncertainty and representativeness of the domain we are trying to model. The paper also concludes that active learning in general has been observed to reduce the number of labeled instances needed when laveling is expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "We would like to focus on ways to get to the same accuracy as on the target domain model only, by enhancing the source domain with a few examples from the target domain. We want to a) detemine how many examples are needed from the target domain when they are selected randomly b) whether we can reduce the number of examples needed by applying heuristics to pick the examples from the target domain that are least represented in the source domain."

    "#### Data Used : \n",
    "The 4 datasets we have used are : \n",
    "Toys and Games : (2,252,771 reviews)   \n",
    "Video Games : (1,324,753 reviews)   \n",

    "Home & Kitchen :  (4,253,926 reviews)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Exploration : \n",
    "The most striking observation from data exploration is that the ratings are strongly skewed towards positive, with 80-85% ratings being 4-5 out of 5. We have not made an attempt to balance the ratings for analysis. We do see better accuracy for positive ratings (~90%) vs for negative ratings (~65-80%). So far we have not chosen to balance the sample since that would mean discarding some positive sample.\n",

We may need to pick a task where there is higher transfer loss for part 2. eg we could look at transfer loss for negative class, or at tranfer loss with predicting more granular ratings - 1,2,3,4,5 instead of binary values."

    "We see that the SVM transfer loss is well correlated with both metrics, though cosine distance gives a wider spread. Based on the graphs, we don't see as much of a correlation between Naive Bayes based transfer loss, and distance / divergence metrics. This seems to be influenced by the fact that the source model built on the auto domain in particular does not transfer well to the other domains with Naive Bayes. Naive Bayes in particular may not handle out of vocabulary words in target domain well - likely setting the probability to 0 in those cases. A deeper error analysis may help our understanding here.\n",
